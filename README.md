# üöÅ Aerial Object Detection / aerial_obj_detection
Machine Learning Object Detection Model Interfaced with ZED Camera on UAV.
Built on the Zero-Shot Object Detection Algorithm: Grounding Dino, providing speed and accuracy.
Implemented on UAV Carrying ZED Camera and Raspberry Pi. but tested with camera on computer.
